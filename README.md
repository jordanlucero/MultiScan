# MultiScan
A macOS app that runs OCR on folders containing images and lets you check its work. Perfect for digitizing long physical books and documents.

Built with fully-native Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, and VisionKit frameworks. Swift 5.9.

Be warned: MultiScan is highly memory-intensive when running OCR and does not properly communicate progress and will hang.

Built with Claude Code, using Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet.
